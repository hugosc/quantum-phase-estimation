# quantum-phase-estimation
Implementation of the Quantum phase estimation algorithm for 5 Qubits using Qiskit. We hope to be able to run it in IBMq5

There are two jupyter notebooks on this repository, **quantum_phase_estimation** is the implementation for a simulator-run algorithm. **quantum_phase_estimation_real_ibm** is our humble attempt at running it on ibm devices.

Below are the results for a very simple run of the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
